To release, you've got to make 7 files

release_notes:
   from any os, copy release/README whomever@grad_network:/users/graphics/public_html/GLOD/releases/glod_1.0pre_readme.txt

glod_1.0pre1_win.zip:

   Login in duca on splat
   press bash button (green & black)
   cd /c/GLOD/vds
   cvs update
   cd /c/GLOD/glod
   cvs update
   explorer .
   
   double click glodlib.dsw

   set glodlib.dsw as active project
   build/rebuild all

   close dev studio and go back to bash

   cd doc
   make clean; make; make npp
   
   cd ../release
   make

   go to the release/win directory in explorer
   and check it for any ickies

   create the zip of the above name
   scp *.zip    whomever@grad_network:/users/graphics/public_html/GLOD/releases/

glod_1.0pre1_src.zip:

   on windows

   make a zip of the code
   turn that into the above filename
   put it in the grad network directory like above


glod_1.0pre1_data.zip
