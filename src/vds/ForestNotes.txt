Forest functions:

public:
-set forest to be valid (checks for existence of nodes/tris and initializes node refs and tri refs)
-give contents (nodes and tris) of one forest to another forest
-read forest data from a Vif class
-write forest data out to an ascii VIF format file
-read forest data from a binary VDS format file
-memory map forest data from a binary VDS format file
-write forest data out to a binary VDS format file
-reset forest (un-memory-map file if file is memory-mapped, delete all nodes, tris, and refs)
-

private:
-set valid
-swap two nodes
-swap actual memory of two nodes
-reorder nodes to depth-first order
-DFSvisit (used by depth-first reordering)
-calculate bounding sphere radii of all nodes in forest
-nil out live tri lists (reset all cuts on forest)
-allocate and initialize node refs and tri refs
-

debug:
-check for duplicate node refs in node refs array
-check if proxies of all triangles match with corresponding proxy backrefs
-print info about given tri
-print into about given node
-print forest structure of nodes in forest
-print info about forest
-highlight first livetri of given node
-highlight next livetri of currently highlighted tri
-highlight given node
-unhighlight highlighted node
-highlight first child node of highlighted node
-highlight right sibling node of highlighted node
-highlight left sibling node of highlighted node
-highlight parent node of highlighted node

Forest data:

public:
-array of nodes
-array of node refs (pointers to nodes' budgetitems in a simplifier queue)
-array of tris
-array of tri refs (indices into nodes' trirenderdatums/proxies in renderer tri renderdata array)
-flag for whether vertex normal information is present
-flag for whether vertex color information is present
-number of textures for which texture coordinates are present
-array of nodes' texture coordinates
-flag for whether forest is valid (i.e. can have a cut instantiated on it)
-flag for whether forest is in core memory or is memory-mapped from disk
-byte pointer to beginning of file that forest is memory-mapped from (if it is memory-mapped)
-flag for whether forest is a merge forest or cluster forest
-number of nodes in forest
-number of tris in forest


private:
-for depth-first sort:
	-index used in depth-first sort
	-array of nodes of forest in depth-first order
	-array of locations of nodes of forest in depth-first ordered array
-

debug:
-index of highlighted node
-index of highlighted tri
