Cut functions:

public:
-give contents of cut to another cut (i.e. make another cut a duplicate of this cut)
-set cut's renderer to given renderer
-set cut's simplifier to given simplifier
-set cut's forest to given forest
-set transformation matrix to given matrix
-update view parameters (from internally stored transformation matrix)
-

private:
-update view frustum plane equations
-

Cut data:

public:
-pointer to forest on which cut is instantiated
-pointer to renderer which is used to render cut
-pointer to simplifier which is used to adjust cut to a threshold or budget constraint
-flag for whether cut is valid (is able to be adapted or rendered)
-number of active nodes contained in cut
-number of active tris contained in cut
-total bytes of memory taken up by cut's nodes (in simplifier queues and renderer renderdata arrays) and tris (in renderer renderdata arrays)
-bytes of memory taken up by a single tri in cut
-bytes of memory taken up by a single node in cut
-transformation matrix (object->eye)
-view information:
	-viewpoint
	-forward vector
	-up vector
	-right vector
	-plane equations of view frustum
	-fov
	-inverse tangent of fov
	-display aspect ratio
	-display resolution
