can we let different patches have different numbers of textures?  that
would mean that the different patches' vertexpositions would have to be
differently sized, and thus in separate arrays (and also separated out
and the patch to which they belonged given in VIF files)
-No, force them to have the same number of texture coordinates for now,
but document this and how you would go about implementing different number
of textures, or, more generally, different sizes of combined vertex
attributes



*make things that don't change const
*try removing nodes above boundary from fold queue and only insert them back into fold queue when all their children are folded
	-need some way to store budgetitems that have been removed from fold queue such that they can be easily accessed when needed to be readded to fold queue

TODO: move tri functions to simplifier for more efficiency and to keep forest nodes/noderefs/tris/triresfs pointers persistent throughout multiple folds/unfolds


disallowing cluster trees allows us to 
-GET RID OF Proxy BackRefs:
	+when unfolding don't need to check if node being unfolded's livetri proxy is actually a corner of a livetri
	+when folding don't need to check if 1 or 2 proxies of livetri of parent are children and not move them up to parent if they are
	-when folding can remove subtris by just checking which livetris of children have two children as proxies
	-use temp proxy backrefs to initialize proxies and live tris
	-pass proxy/corner into AddToLiveTriList/UsingCorners instead of having to get it from proxy backrefs
