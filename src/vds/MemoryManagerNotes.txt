Manager is only in charge of memory used when rendering - i.e. memory that could be video/AGP memory.

MemoryManager functions:

public:
-free all memory allocated
-allocate renderdata memory for given number of vertices and tris for given renderer
-add renderer to memory manager
-remove renderer from memory manager
-

private:
-initialize nvidia extensions
-initialize ati extensions
-


MemoryManager data:

public:
-number of renderers for whom this manager is currently handling memory
-flag for each renderer representing in which type of memory renderer's renderdata is allocated (system memory, video memory, AGP memory, VAR memory, etc..)
-base address of allocation for each renderer
-size of allocation for each renderer
-hardware suggested limit to number of vertices per vertex array
-

private:
-flag for if nvidia extensions are enabled, if ati extensions are enabled, if both are disabled, or if both haven't been tested yet
